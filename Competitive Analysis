The following site aims to give an overview and procedures for entering a FOIA request, analysing resulting competitor data, and applying "lessons learned" for future use. 

In this site you will find:

#. What is FOIA?
#. FOIA Request Procedures
#. FOIA Storage Procedures
#. Guidelines for content analysis
#. Task-list for "Lessons Learned"

By the end you will be able to:

* Know the right steps to procure FOIA information
* Successfully analyse bid scoring and FOIA documents
* Put your best foot forward!
